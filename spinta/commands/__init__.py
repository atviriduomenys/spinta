    - On double updates, i.e. when we are updating attribute values, which
    are already saved in the DB, then `data.patch` will ignore those values,
    thus on nested fields we may overwrite already existing values, e.g.
        schema = {'obj': {'foo': string, 'bar': string}};
        data.saved = {'obj': {'foo': '42', 'bar': 'baz'}};
        data.given = {'obj': {'foo': '13', 'bar': 'baz'}};
